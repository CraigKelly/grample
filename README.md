# Introduction

This software package is designed to read Markov networks and perform
marginal estimation using Gibbs sampling. The main motivation for
creating Yet Another MCMC software package was research: this is the
experimental implementation of Adaptive Rao-Blackwellisation that
Deepak Venugopal and I have been working on.
